##About
This application allows to calculate various financial measures while analyzing financial statements.

Main task was logical and intuitive arrangement of calculated measures.

Location of each element was defined taking into account structure of financial reports, database structure and typical workflow.

##Features
+ Entered data affects all measures real time as analyst inputs data. Multiple measures can be calculated simultaneously. The analyst can revise data that has been entered.
+ Measure label itself contains additional information and excerpts from the policy on how to conduct calculations. This saves time and helps newcomers.
+ The responsive layout allows resizing appâ€™s window and organizing workspace with maximum efficiency.

As simple as it is, the main feature of this application is its functionality,
while design remains strict and unostentatious.
